## Summary
Pinbox allows users to save their search queries in a savable, readable, and customizable pin environment. With Pinbox, you can search as usual, and once you find content you like and want to save, you can post it to your Pinbox and come back to it at any time. Save multiple content to one card, remove content entirely, or add  more later, Pinbox is tailor made for the way you search.
